                <h2>What is “Bukki's Play School”?</h2>

                <p>
                    This project aims to create a compelling game set within the haunted cyber space of the Online Edutainment Platform known as “Bukki's Play School”. Within this digital realm devoid of any players, there are only three things you can do:
                    <em>"Study, Explore, Survive”</em>
                </p>
                <h3>Core Game Loop:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Study</b> – set out on an Adventure with your teacher “Bukki”, to learn about Mathematics, Science, History, Language, Technology and much more! Complete various activities aimed to make learning fun and easy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Explore</b> – travel through the procedurally generated school! Filled with puzzles to solve, monsters to hide from, and mysteries to uncover! Whether it’s the ordinary rooms of the school, or the unnerving spaces of the other side, evil lurks around the corner.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Survive</b> – when the veil is lifted, you will have to run, hide and fight. Use your knowledge to get through the unforgiving challenges and reach salvation.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>All this and more within the world of “Bukki's Play School”. I hope to see you there!</p>
